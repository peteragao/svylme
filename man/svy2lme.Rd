\title{
Linear mixed models by pairwise likelihood
}
\description{
Fits linear mixed models by profile pairwise composite likelihood. At the moment, it can only handle two-stage designs and two-level models, where the model clusters and sampling clusters are the same. In the future, settings where the model structure is nested in the design structure should be feasible.

\arguments{
  \item{formula}{
    Model formula as in the \code{lme4} package
  }
  \item{data}{
    data frame
  }
  \item{p1}{
    Vector of stage-one sampling probabilities
  }
  \item{p2}{
    if not \code{NULL}, a vector of stage-two sampling probabilities:
    these are treated as if they were sampled with replacement. 
  }
  \item{N2}{
    if \code{p2} is \code{NULL}, the size of the stage-one sampling
    units (in the population). The stage-two sampling is treated as
    SRS without replacement.
  }
  \item{sterr}{
    Estimate standard errors for fixed effects? Set to \code{FALSE} for
    greater speed when using resampling to get standard errors.
    }

    \item{object}{code{svy2lme} object}
    \item{random}{if \code{TRUE}, the variance components rather than
    the fixed effects}

\details{
  The population pairwise likelihood would be the sum of the
    loglikelihoods for a pair of observations, taken over all pairs of
    observations from the same cluster.  This is estimated by taking a
    weighted sum over pairs in the sample, with the weights being the
    reciprocals of pairwise sampling probabilities. The advantage over
    standard weighted pseudolikelihoods is that there is no
    large-cluster assumption needed and no rescaling of weights. The
    disadvantage is some loss of efficiency (to an extent that isn't
    well understood), and simpler point estimation.
  
    The code uses \code{lme4::lmer} to parse the formula and produce
    starting values, profiles out the fixed effects and residual
    variance, and then uses \code{minqa::bobyqa} to maximise the
    resulting profile deviance.

    As with \code{lme4::lmer}, the default is to estimate the
    correlations of the random effects, since there is typically  no
    reason to assume these are zero. You can force two random effects to
    be independent by entering them in separate terms, eg
    \code{(1|g)+(-1+x|g)} in the model formula asks for a random slope
    and random intercept forced to be zero.
    
    The internal parametrisation of the variance components uses the
    Cholesky decomposition of the relative vairance matrix (the variance
    matrix divided by the residual variance), as in
    \code{lme4::lmer}. The component \code{object$s2} contains the
    estimated residual variance and the component \code{object$opt$par}
    contains the elements of the Cholesky factor in column-major order,
    omitting any elements that are forced to be zero by requiring
    indepedent random effects. 
    
    Standard errors of the fixed effects are currently estimated using a
    "with replacement" approximation, valid when the sampling fraction
    is small and superpopulation (model, process) inference is intended.	
  
}
\value{
  \code{svy2lme} returns an object with \code{print}, \code{coef}, and
  \code{vcov} methods.

  The \code{coef} method with \code{random=TRUE} returns a two-element
  list: the first element is the estimated residual variance, the second
  is the matrix of estimated variances and covariances of the random effects.
